# FontUpdate

Patches LC's Font and adds the Expanded Unicode Latin Characters.

As of right now the mod has two main configurations:

- **Normal**: Uses the updated font.
- **NoDollar**: Uses a version of the updated font without the $ symbol (missing in the vanilla font too) in case you run into unexpected formatting issues with other mods or "ghosting" behind characters.

### To Do:
- Expand the font further (Adding more Unicode characters).
- Update the Transmit font.
### Known Issues:
- "The character used for underline is not available in font asset" warning, for now it doesn't seem to be noticeable a problem in-game, but I'll keep investigating.
- Some mods that change the formatting of the console might break with this mod's "Normal" setting (because of the $ symbol restoration), if you're experiencing this please activate the "NoDollar" setting and/or contact me and the original modder.

If you are a modder or tester and want to help me a little feel free to jump to the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1351759076782116917), any help and feedback is very welcome!

**And to all of you people!** I was shocked looking at how many people has been downloading it. This is my first time tinkering with code and unity assets, it makes me so happy to see many of you using this mod, I'll try my best to keep making it better!
