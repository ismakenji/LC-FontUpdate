# FontUpdate

Updates LC's Font and adds the Expanded Unicode Latin Characters.
**THIS IS A WIP**

**Thank you so much for +1k downloads!!** This was my first time trinkering with unity and LC modding in general, I'm still learning but I'll try to make this mod as good as I possibly can.

### To Do:
- Expand the font further (Adding more Unicode characters).
- Update the Transmit font.
### Known Issues:
- "The character used for underline is not available in font asset" warning, for now it doesn't seem to be noticeable a problem in-game, but I'll keep investigating.
- Sometimes the Font can look a little weird in a couple of instances.
If you are a modder and want to help me a little feel free to jump to the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1350586528656789514), any help is very welcome!
